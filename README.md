Preamble
Part A
Part B
Part C
Part D
Part E

All intrcution are provided in repo.

I mark is given to students who can complete till Part D and bunus marks to students who can get Part E done also.

So far we've extablished all the classes up to Part C which look good. Also I've added classes for Part D but there are errors. Errors have been coomented out so project still runs.

If you run project you will get the GUI. Top left click Game>New then you can click roll dice and random face values appear. You can click check boxes to hold values and roll again.  That it for functionality. We need to get the game scoring for at least two palyers.
